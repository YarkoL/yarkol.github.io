		This is an example how I usually submit comics scripts, if no 
		particular format has been specified. I sketch lightly the panel contents 
to give an idea of the picture composition and balloon placement. This 
enables the artist to work easily and swiftly.</p>
<p>This little continuity of strips was originally submitted to Rovio, but was turned down, since at the time they were more interested in one-shot gag strips. So it is presented here as "fan art".</p>
